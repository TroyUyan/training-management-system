sql for a course a user HAS NOT taken:: (sub select)
SELECT course_id, course_name FROM courses
WHERE department_id = 1 AND 
course_id NOT IN 
(SELECT course_id FROM users_courses WHERE user_id = 15)

----

when adding employee records do it per course
department selected with get request then conditional if dept_id = 1 etc,
^^
use a loop to cycle through all the availble courses then check boxes to check which employees where there
OR
pick dept with get, dropdown for courses, slider for number of employees that were present, POST, then it shows that amount of input forms with data keygen to fill which employee was there
^^^
then from either uber bulk SQL statement submitted to users_courses table

Course schedule for employees, can view records or view upcoming courses for classes they havent taken yet.
^ Randomly generated dates in the next two weeks, random result for an array with times [2:30, 3, 3:30, etc] to display a random time and then random array of room numbers
